üìà Employee Salary Prediction with Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning solution developed to predict whether an individual's annual income is <=50K or >50K based on various demographic and employment attributes. Utilizing the Adult Census Income Dataset, this project demonstrates a complete workflow from data understanding and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and interactive deployment using Streamlit. It serves as a testament to my skills in building robust, data-driven applications.

‚ú® Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth analysis to understand data distributions, identify outliers, and uncover relationships between features.

Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering: Comprehensive handling of missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical features, and creating new, insightful features (e.g., capital_gain_loss_diff, marital_status_simplified).

Machine Learning Pipeline: Development of a streamlined ColumnTransformer and a Logistic Regression (or replace with your actual model, e.g., RandomForestClassifier) model to automate preprocessing and prediction.

Model Training & Evaluation: Training on a robust dataset and evaluating performance using key metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Interactive Web Application: Deployment of the trained model into a user-friendly Streamlit web application for single and batch predictions.

Batch Prediction Capability: Allows users to upload a CSV file for bulk income predictions, demonstrating scalability.

üöÄ Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Scikit-learn: For machine learning model building, preprocessing, and pipeline management.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization during EDA.

Streamlit: For building and deploying the interactive web application.

üìä Dataset
The project utilizes the Adult Census Income Dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains over 48,000 instances with 14 attributes such as age, workclass, education, marital status, occupation, race, gender, capital gains/losses, hours per week, and native country, with the target variable being income class (<=50K or >50K).

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run Locally
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
(Remember to replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPO_NAME with your actual GitHub details.)

Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):

Bash

python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
Install Dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook:

Start Jupyter Notebook:

Bash

jupyter notebook
Open employee_salary_prediction.ipynb.

Run all cells from top to bottom. This step is crucial as it performs the EDA, training, and saves the model_pipeline.pkl file, which app.py relies on.

Run the Streamlit Application:

After the notebook successfully completes and model_pipeline.pkl is generated:

Open a new terminal (or use the existing one, ensuring your virtual environment is active).

Navigate to the project root directory if you're not already there.

Run the Streamlit app:

Bash

streamlit run app.py
This will open the application in your default web browser.

üìà Model Insights & Performance (Example Metrics - Replace with your actuals)
The trained model (Logistic Regression / RandomForestClassifier) achieved robust performance in classifying income levels:

Accuracy: Approximately 85%

Precision (for >50K): Around 75%

Recall (for >50K): Around 60%

F1-Score (for >50K): Approximately 67%

ROC-AUC Score: ~0.90

(Important: Replace these example metrics with the actual performance metrics you obtained from running your employee_salary_prediction.ipynb notebook. This demonstrates your analytical rigor.)

üí° Future Enhancements
Hyperparameter Tuning: Implement advanced techniques (e.g., GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV) for optimal model performance.

Explore Other Models: Experiment with Gradient Boosting, SVMs, or Neural Networks for comparison.

Interpretability: Use tools like SHAP or LIME to explain model predictions.

Robust Error Handling: Enhance error messages and input validations in the Streamlit app for an even smoother user experience.

Dockerization: Containerize the application for easier deployment across different environments.

CI/CD Pipeline: Implement continuous integration and deployment for automated testing and deployment.
